# Portfolio: Add a contact form and finish the mobile version

> For the second milestone in the process of creating my portfolio website:

1. I set up a new repository and prepare it for development using best practices (e.g. linters).
2. Add a contact form to my portfolio and the portfolio of my coding partner.
3. I guide my users' experience in a way that helps them fill in the form without frustration.
